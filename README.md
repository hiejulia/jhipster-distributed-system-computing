            + 
    + gRPC for 1 service : written with Go
+ Distributed crawler 


## Principle for performance tuning 
- Understand you env 
- TANSTAAFL!
- throughput versus latency 
- DO NOT OVERUTILIZE A RESOURCE



## Implementation 
- deployment service with kubernetes 
+ Distributed Cache server 
    + HazelCast distributed caching 
    - varnish distributed cache 
- replicated load balance 
- nginx replicated 
- sharded caching with memcache(replica)
    - twemproxy for Redis 

+ Distributed messaging 
    + ActiveMQ
    + Kafka 
+ Distributed DB
    + Data partition 
    + Riak 
    + Cassandra  
+ Distributed file system : 
    + Hadoop, HDFS
+ Distributed DNS 
+ Distributed proxy server
+ Distributed web server 
+ Utilize cloud services: 
    + AWS : AWS ELB 
    - Google S2 geometry lib 
    - cloud native d d
+ Network communication 
    + Async 
    + Axon framework : CQRS 
    + Web socket 
    + RMI, CORBA
    + gRPC 
    - TChannel : network multiplexing and framing protocol for RPC 
    
- distributed locking 
- distributed tracing, tracking, logging
- distributed scheduling 
- distributed security 
- distributed messaging, queuing, event streaming 
- distributed search 
- distributed storage 
- CD/CI scaling 



+ Distributed architecture  
    + peer-to-peer;

	+ client/server;
		- multi-tier;

	+ mobile agents;

    + Reactive 
        + Akka : HTTP, stream, clustering, sharding, actors 
        + Domain sourcing 
        + Distributed domain driven design 
        + CQRS 
    + Bulkhead pattern
    + Distributed domain  
- event sourcing architecture 
    - event driven batch processing

## Availability 
- Resilience engineer 
- Failover
- LB
- Rate limit 
- Autoscale
- Global availability 
- HA 
- Circuit breaker
- timeouts


## Performance 
- OS, storage, database, network 
- Performance tuning with GC 
- Performance optimization with Image, video, page load

# Distributed cloud computing 


# Scalability 
+ Universal scalability laws 
    

# Server clustering 


# LB 

# Testing 
+ Multi JVM testing 

# Container distributed application 
+ Debug a service running in a container 
+ minimized docker images using multi stage
+ secure distributed app 
    + kubernetes secret 
    + secrets in env
    + External secrets like HashiCorp Vault 
+ make service scale  
+ techniques to increase resiliency 
+ availability check 
+ enable zero downtime updates 
+ Prod deployment 
    + Kubernetes pods, replicasets, deployment, services 
    + create template
    + orchestrator 
    + deploy on premise/ cloud 
    + peek into 2 big corp hosted kubernetes SaaS : Microsoft azure & google cloud 

+ Prod 
    + self heal 
    + update service, avoid cascading failures
